    <h2>"Long-Leg Lou and Short-Leg Sue"</h2>
    <p>Long –Leg Lou and Short-Leg Sue, Went for a walk down the avenue, Laughin’ and jokin’ like good friends do, Long-Leg Lou and Short-Leg Sue.</p><p>Says Long–Leg Lou to Short-Leg Sue, “Can’t you walk faster than you do? It really drives me out of my mind That I’m always in front, and you’re always behind.”</p><p>Says Short -Leg Sue to Long-Leg Lou, “I walk as fast as I’m meant to do. Then I’ll go walking with someone new,”Says Long-Leg Lou to Short-Leg Sue. </p><p>Now Long-Leg Lou, he walks alone, Looking for someone with legs like his own. And sometimes he thinks of those warm after-noons, Back when he went walkin’ with Short-Leg Sue.</p><p>And Short-Leg Sue strolls down the street, Hand in hand with Slow –Foot Pete. And they take small steps and they do just fine, And no one’s in front and no one’s behind.</p>
